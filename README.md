# My Learning Portfolio: Machine Learning, NLP & MLOps

## 🚀 Welcome to My Learning Journal

This repository serves as my active learning journal and comprehensive code portfolio for the **[Complete Machine Learning, NLP Bootcamp MLOps & Deployment](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-nlp-bootcamp-mlops-deployment/)** course, taught by Krish Naik.

I am using this space to document my entire progress—from foundational algorithms to complex, end-to-end deployed models. All code, notes, and projects I complete will be stored and organized here.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am **Ankit Kumar**, a postgraduate student currently pursuing my **M.Tech in Land and Water Resources Engineering (LWRE) at IIT Kharagpur**.

My academic background is in agricultural (major in Renewable) engineering, and I am passionate about applying cutting-edge data science and machine learning techniques to solve complex environmental and hydrological challenges.

This course is a key part of my journey to bridge the gap between traditional engineering and modern artificial intelligence. My goal is to leverage these skills to build intelligent systems for:
* Hydrological modeling and flood forecasting
* Satellite image analysis and remote sensing
* Water quality prediction
* Climate change impact assessment

Feel free to connect with me!
